# Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview
This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights. The task is part of the **Data Analyst Internship - Task 5**.

## Objective
- Understand the structure and key attributes of the Titanic dataset.
- Perform statistical and visual exploration.
- Identify relationships, trends, and anomalies.
- Summarize findings with proper observations.

## Dataset Description
We have worked with the following files:
- `train.csv` — Training dataset containing passenger details and survival status.
- `test.csv` — Test dataset (without survival status).
- `gender_submission.csv` — A sample submission file for predictions.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## EDA Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Understanding**
2. **Data Cleaning**
3. **Univariate Analysis**
4. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**
5. **Correlation Analysis**
6. **Observations and Summary**

## Key Insights
- **Gender**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **Pclass**: Passengers in 1st class survived more compared to 2nd and 3rd classes.
- **Age**: Younger passengers (children) had a higher chance of survival.
- **Fare**: Higher ticket fare was positively correlated with survival probability.
- **Embarkation Port**: Port of embarkation showed slight influence on survival.

## Conclusion
This EDA helped understand the Titanic dataset deeply, laying a strong foundation for predictive modeling and further machine learning tasks.
